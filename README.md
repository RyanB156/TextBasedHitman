# TextBasedHitman
A command line game inspired by the Hitman series. Your mission is to find and eliminate your targets. 
Procedurally generated maps ensure a unique experience every time you play.  

The project TextBasedRPG contains the main source for the game, written in F#.  
The project CustomConsole is a wrapper for the command line written in C#. It allows the player to press tab to autocomplete what they have typed and use the arrow keys up and down to repeat past commands.  

Everything but the console wrapper is written in a pure functional style with F#.
